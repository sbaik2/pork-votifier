# pork-votifier

Pork votifier uses the original votifier protocol. (See more at [here](https://github.com/vexsoftware/votifier/wiki/Protocol-Documentation)).

The original votifier was purposely chosen to be able to support as many server versions as possible.

NuVotifier also uses GNU GPL 3.0: A privilege we cant have in the competition.
